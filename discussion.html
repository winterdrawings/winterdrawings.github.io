<title>Small Talk </title>
<h1>Discussion time! </h1>
<img src="" alt="">
<p> You have decided to calm yourslf down and walked out of the stall just to talk with your frend. She asks you whats worng so then you told her what is in you mind and how you want to quit the team and give up.
After your freind hears you venting, she understands how you are feeling and reasons why you shouldn't quit. At least not now. She encourages you to stay and finish the season out strong and you did.
Just with a small talk, it can really change a persons mind.</p>
