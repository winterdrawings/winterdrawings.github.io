<p>Hello! Welcome to my Portfolio! My name is Shiley and I'm currently working on getting my BFA on Digital Media Art at San Jose State! I'm from the eastbay but I'm currently staying at San Jose to work for my BFA.
I loved learning about mutlimedia in high school and wanted to pursue art in the digital world. I manly work on drawing original character but want to expand my art. I work with adobe photoshop, Illustrator, Indesign, and premire, capcut and canva.</p>
